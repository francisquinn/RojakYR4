### Project overview

Tactical analysis is typically collected manually during Gaelic football matches by painstakingly gathering data by viewing the recording after the match or sometimes by using pen and paper to write down in-game statistics. This process is often very time consuming and expensive due to the physical and software technologies available on the market.

TacTalk is a mobile and web application that is looking to solve this problem by using voice recognition technology to automatically collect and store real-time match statistics during a Gaelic football match. The match statistical data can then be further analyzed directly after the match, saving teams both time and money.
