### Project overview

Tactical analysis is typically collected manually during Gaelic football matches by painstakingly gathering data by viewing the recording after the match or sometimes by using pen and paper to write down in-game statistics. This process is often very time consuming and expensive due to the physical and software technologies available on the market.

**TacTalk** is a mobile and web application that is looking to solve this problem by using voice recognition technology to automatically collect and store **real-time** match statistics during a Gaelic football match. The match statistical data can then be further analyzed directly after the match, saving teams both **time and money**.

### How does TacTalk work?
A match analyst on the side-line uses the voice recognition application to **record verbally** in-game activities such as goals, shots, missed chances etc. The analyst would use a vocabulary of key words to mark events that are happening during the match and have the ability to link the event to a player either by number or by name. The app will send the speech input file to the server to be converted into a text format suitable for the database.

Once the data is stored correctly in the database it can be used to display the **half time statistics** during a match to the manager to discover areas of improvement or weaknesses of the team.

When the match has finished, the match statistical data can then be analyzed further in greater detail showing a visual representation of the pitch and marking the different events that had occurred during the match.
